## 1. [IBM Deep Learning Fundamentals](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/course-v1:DeepLearning.TV+ML0115EN+v2.0)
- Get a crash course on the what there is to learn and how to go about learning more. Deep Learning presents a simplified explanation of some of the hottest topics in data science today:

  - What is Deep Learning?
  - What are are convolutional neural networks?
  - Why is deep learning so powerful and what can it be used for?
  - Be part of a rapidly growing field in data science; there's no better time than now to get started with neural networks.

## 2. [IBM Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/course-v1:BigDataUniversity+ML0120EN+v2)
- Traditional neural networks rely on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kind of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which consitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

- TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement deep learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressional, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

## 3. [IBM Accelerating Deep Learning with GPUs](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/course-v1:IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork+ML0122ENv3+v1)

- Training complex deep learning models with large datasets takes along time. In this course, you will learn how to use accelerated GPU hardware to overcome the scalability problem in deep learning.

  - Explain what GPU is, how it can speed up the computation, and its advantages in comparison with CPUs.
  - Implement deep learning networks on GPUs.
  - Train and deploy deep learning networks for image and video classification as well as for object recognition.
